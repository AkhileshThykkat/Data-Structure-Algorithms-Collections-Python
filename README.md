# Data Structues and Algorithms Collection Python
In this repo I upload everything I do related to data structures and algorithm that I learned to solve, implement it. The goal of this repo is to have simple readable scratch implementation of data structures with notes and proper documentation. Along with Coding Interview problems and its solutions.

Hope it helps you. Don't forgot to :star:.
